<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective Date: February 9, 2026</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> DayDot does not collect, transmit, or share any personal
data with the developer or third parties. All data stays on your device and, if you
choose, in your personal iCloud account. No accounts, no analytics, no tracking,
no ads, no servers.</p>
</div>

<h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
<p>DayDot does not collect: your name, email, phone number, location, device identifiers,
analytics, crash reports, browsing history, health data, financial data, or advertising data.
The App contains no third-party SDKs, analytics frameworks, or tracking technologies.</p>

<h2>2. Information You Create</h2>
<p>You create countdown events (titles, dates, categories, colors, photos, notification
preferences). This data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.
The developer has no access to this data.</p>

<h2>3. Photos</h2>
<p>Photos are selected via Apple's PhotosPicker (limited access only). They are downsampled
to max 1200px, compressed to JPEG (max 500KB), and stored in the app's sandboxed container.
Photos are excluded from device backups. You can remove photos at any time.</p>

<h2>4. iCloud Sync</h2>
<p>DayDot optionally syncs events via Apple's CloudKit (private database). Data is encrypted
in transit and at rest by Apple. The developer has no access to your iCloud data. If you
disable iCloud, the app functions fully as local-only.</p>

<h2>5. Notifications</h2>
<p>All notifications are local (scheduled on-device). No push notification server is used.
No notification data is transmitted externally.</p>

<h2>6. Widgets & Local Preferences</h2>
<p>Widget data is shared between app and widget extension via on-device App Group container.
Preferences (haptics, notification toggle) are stored in local UserDefaults. None of this
data leaves your device.</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>DayDot collects no personal information from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

<h2>8. Your Rights (GDPR/CCPA)</h2>
<p>Because DayDot stores no data on developer servers, all GDPR/CCPA rights are inherently
satisfied. You can view, edit, and delete all data directly within the app. Uninstalling
removes all local data. iCloud data can be managed via iOS Settings.</p>

<h2>9. Changes</h2>
<p>Updates to this policy will be posted here with an updated effective date.</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
<p>Email: <a href="mailto:ssx51f@gmail.com">ssx51f@gmail.com</a></p>
